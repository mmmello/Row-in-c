## Row in C

For a full understanding of this subject it is necessary to have prior knowledge about double linked lists. In my profile there is a repository that covers this subject.

The project consists of a data structure that stores data in FIFO (first in, first out) order. That is, the first element to enter the structure is the first to leave. In order for the queue to work well, it will be necessary to implement two pointers, so we can operate on both sides of the queue at the same time.

The program is developed in the C programming language.

For the current project, it should be based on the idea that no repeated numbers will be inserted.

Run the program preferably in visual studio code. Running it in the Clion compiler I found some unexplained bugs.
